Discover the magic of making apps with Mobi! ü™Ñ

Mobi strives to make an inclusive learning environment where students of all majors and skills can come together to develop software, such as in our weekly Social Codings and Mobi Bytes.

Events:

Social Coding is a super beginner friendly way to get hands-on experience. Learn to code and even deploy your own app with others! There is complete creative freedom, so the coding wizards can show off their skills too! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Mobi Bytes are videos on our YouTube channel! These *byte* sized videos guarantee you gain a vital new tech skill for your next app.

Mobi is active in the hackathon community, attending events across the state of Texas, with active members participating and mentoring.

MavPitch is a competition to win $40,000 to turn your idea into a reality. Multiple Mobi members have gone on to fund their own startups with their winnings.
