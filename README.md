#  Video Tutorial
We have a detailed guide on our YouTube channel on [How to use GitHub for Social Coding by Devrat Patel](https://youtu.be/N12wZBzG4Hw?si=2fhzHsXaq-sz_mzX) as part of our Mobi Byte series.  

# Getting Started

Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
Click on the "Sign up" button at the top-right corner of the screen and create an account.  

Enter your email address.  

Create a password.  

Enter a username.  

Verify your account.  

Enter the code that is sent to your email address.  

# Fork 

Now that you have a GitHub, you can now visit the [GitHub repository for Social Coding](https://github.com/mobiclub/social-coding)

In the top-right corner, click on the Star button! :D  

Next, click on the Fork button.  

We recommend you choose your own username as the owner.  
The repository name can stay as "social-coding".  
Copy the main branch only should remain ticked.  

Click on the "Create fork" button.  

Now you have your own forked social-coding repository. This will act as a copy and a symbolic link between you and us. This is beneficial because unlike the main mobiclub social-coding repository, you will be able to make changes to your own forked social-coding repository. Afterwards, you'll be able to send us your changes in the form of pull requests.  

We'll show you how to do that now.
